# üîç REXIS ‚Äî Retrieval-Enhanced eXploration of Infected Software

**REXIS** is an experimental framework designed to enhance static malware analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project explores how contextual retrieval from external knowledge sources can improve the accuracy, interpretability, and justifiability of LLM-based malware classification.

Built for cybersecurity research, **REXIS** focuses on analyzing static features (e.g., bytecode, file structure, API calls) and comparing its performance against traditional static analysis techniques.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üì¶ Static malware analysis with LLMs  
- üîç Context-aware insights using Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
- üìä Benchmarking against traditional detection techniques  
- üß† Emphasis on explainability and contextual reasoning  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Toolchain

- **Code Retrieval & RAG Pipeline:**  
  - [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) ‚Äî used to build the pipeline between decompiled malware samples and the LLM

- **AI Engine:**  
  - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) ‚Äî for general-purpose, high-accuracy LLM queries  
  - [DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai) ‚Äî for code-centric language understanding and reasoning

- **Static Analysis Input:**  
  - Decompiled source code and structural features from known malware datasets  
  - Recommended decompilation tools include:  
    - [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)  
    - [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)  
    - Any tool producing readable code or bytecode representations suitable for static analysis

- **Datastore (Vector Database):**  
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension  
  - Used to store and query embeddings for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
  - Integrated with the Haystack pipeline for vector-based semantic search and context retrieval

## üìÇ Project Structure _(Coming Soon)_

> This section will outline the repo structure, including modules for data ingestion, RAG querying, LLM prompts, and evaluation.

---

## üìà Evaluation & Benchmarks _(Planned)_

> REXIS will be tested against traditional static analysis tools and scored based on:
- Accuracy of classification
- Justifiability of output
- Contextual relevance of LLM explanations
- Efficiency of the analysis pipeline

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

REXIS uses Python `3.13+` and is managed using [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/).  
Ensure you have Python 3.13 installed and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) running with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension enabled.

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- PDM (`pip install pdm`)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- OpenAI and/or DeepSeek API credentials

### üöÄ Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/andremmfaria/rexis
cd rexis

# Install dependencies
pdm install

# Create a ./config/.secrets.toml file for your API keys and database config
cp ./config/.secrets_template.toml ./config/.secrets.toml
```

## üß™ Usage

REXIS is containerized for reproducibility and ease of development. The project uses `docker-compose` to manage two main services:

- `app`: The main application (e.g. RAG pipeline, interface, analysis logic)
- `db`: PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension for vector-based semantic search

---

### üê≥ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create your `.env` file** in the root of the project by copying from the template file (`.env-template`):

```dotenv
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=super_secret_password
POSTGRES_DB=rexis
```

2. **Build and start the containers**:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

3. **App source code and configuration**:
   - Application code lives in `./src/`
   - Configuration files (via Dynaconf) are in `./config/`

4. **Stopping the containers**:

```bash
docker compose down
```

5. **Persistent data**:  
PostgreSQL data is stored in a Docker volume named `pgdata` and will persist between restarts.
